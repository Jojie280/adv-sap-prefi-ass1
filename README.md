## Assignment in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).
- In my own Defining, the service-oriented architecture is a broad enterprise that can approach software development and provide a good advantage for business applications, and it contains information about services about business and how they can execute a business properly that you do, and by using it, you can communicate well on different platforms.
2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
-Standardized Services Contracts – In terms of standardized services contracts They maintained that their service contracts were equal so that they could be implemented properly.
-Loose Coupling – In terms of loose coupling, the dependencies in service contracts will be minimized, and for the consumers, they can keep them minimized so that their relationship with each other will be good.
-Abstraction – In terms of abstraction, it can choose what role they want, and it avoids corruption in implementing data.
-Service Reusability – In terms of Service Reusability, you can use it again, but you must divide its services first so that it is not maximized in its reuse.
-Autonomy – In terms of autonomy, it contains the logic that if they want to choose what they encapsulate, it also means that they want to achieve the goal.
-Statelessness – In terms of Statelessness it is stating that what you want the goal in the business by using a logic and improve the services that you created.
-Discoverability – In terms of discoverability he can be easily discovered every time, and here you can find him communicating what the purpose of meta data in a business service is.
-Composability – In terms of Composability, it is related to service reusability they have a relationship to deal how to execute the service and to flex it manually.
-Interoperability – In terms of Interoperability it states that cooperation by exchanging information to the services.

3. Define Microservices.
- In my own Defining, the microservices is also a type of architecture that has special components and is adopted by a wide range of business enterprises. But they use an individual method to make it expandable, and another microservice has a cloud approach, so they can share every task they perform and update it immediately. In the cloud, they use small components to be more efficient in entering the business.
4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
-Right tool for the job – In these benefits using the right tool is important because if you use the right tool, you can identify what elements that you want to use, and it helps this the database.
-Precise scaling – In these benefits it states that using individual to generate the result of the entire applications.
-Independently deployable – To be able to deploy freely to combine code in this method is easy and easy with small amount changes.

5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
-The similarity between the two is that they are both used in a business, they are both reusable, and they have components. The difference between them is that SOA requires the specific business to be executed, and microservices use the cloud to make it easier for them to update their business, but in microservices there are small components so that they can organize the tasks in implementing the business.
